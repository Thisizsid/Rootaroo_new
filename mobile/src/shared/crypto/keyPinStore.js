/**
 * Key Pin Store — TOFU (Trust On First Use) public key pinning.
 *
 * Threat model: the server may substitute its own RSA public key when
 * responding to GET /vault/keys in order to intercept a key wrapping operation.
 * To detect this, we pin each user's public key on first contact (TOFU) and
 * compare every subsequent server response against the stored pin.
 *
 * If the server-provided key differs from the pinned key, the operation is
 * blocked and the user is explicitly notified. The new key is never silently
 * accepted — the user must re-verify before the pin is updated.
 *
 * TOFU limitation: the very first key fetch has no prior pin to compare against.
 * This is the same trust model as SSH. A MitM on day-zero first contact could
 * substitute a key and it would be trusted. This is a documented, explicit
 * tradeoff. A future fast-follow will add fingerprint display at key-setup time
 * to close this window.
 *
 * Storage: pins live in SecureStore without requireAuthentication (pins are not
 * secret — a pin is a public key; knowing it does not grant vault access).
