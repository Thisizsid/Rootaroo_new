/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  Centralised keyboard handling — the single place this app decides
 *  how the keyboard interacts with layout. Change it here, every
 *  screen follows.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHY ANDROID ALSO NEEDS AN EXPLICIT AVOIDER NOW
 *
 * The long-standing recipe in this codebase was:
 *
 *     behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : undefined}
 *
 * which relied on Android's `windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` shrinking
 * the window so content moved on its own. Expo SDK 54 turns Android
 * edge-to-edge ON by default and it can no longer be disabled (the
 * `edgeToEdgeEnabled` flag is removed in SDK 55). Under edge-to-edge the
 * window is NOT resized when the keyboard opens — the keyboard simply
 * draws over the app. `behavior={undefined}` makes KeyboardAvoidingView a
 * literal no-op, so on Android those screens now do nothing at all.
 *
 * Android therefore needs the same explicit avoidance iOS always did.

/**
 * The one knob. If a platform ever needs re-tuning, change it here only.
 *
 * iOS   → 'padding' pads the bottom of the avoider by the keyboard height.
 * Android → 'height' shrinks the avoider to the space left above the
 *           keyboard. Preferred over 'padding' here because most screens in
 *           this app pin a footer/CTA with `marginTop:'auto'` or
 *           `justifyContent:'space-between'`, which only reflows correctly
 *           when the container itself gets shorter.

 * Props to spread onto a screen's EXISTING ScrollView / FlatList / SectionList

 *
 * - keyboardShouldPersistTaps 'handled' → a tap on a button while the keyboard
 *   is open fires that button instead of being swallowed by the dismiss.
 * - keyboardDismissMode → drag the list down to dismiss (interactive on iOS).
